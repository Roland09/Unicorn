A custom made Unicorn Horn with optional rainbow particle effects. I used it in combination with [Horse Animset Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/horse-animset-pro-riding-system-79902) and thought I'd share.

When you use it in HAP, drag it over to the "Horsi_ Head" GameObject part of your HAP Horse and align the relative position and angle.
